cmp   added engine.data as default root for orphan object creation
cmp   Blocks disppear on second time viewSrf
cmp   fixed TypeError('not all arguments converted during string formatting'
      if Block type1 is not 0
      because get type color needs an int but got string
cmp	correctly inherit parent attributes into split srfs
cmp	relate split srf for mesh generation

wip save block types into rhino object name when set block type
    so that the engines remembers the block type when aquiring from layer
